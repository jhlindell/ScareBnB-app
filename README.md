# scarebnb

ScareBnB is an app that allows users to earn revenue by renting rooms in their houses which happen to be haunted. This allows adventurous travelers to book lodging in unique settings, creating unique experiences.

This app will be built using React and Bootstrap for the front end experience. For the server, Node.js and Express.js will handle serving files. PostgreSQL and Knex will be used for database access.

MVP for ScareBnB will include:

1. users will be able to log in and be authenticated.
2. a user can set themselves up as a host and list rooms for rent.
3. users can see a list of rooms posted for rental.
4. users can select a specific post and be taken to a page that displays room details and allows for booking.
5. a user can book a posted room for a single, or multiple days.
6. a host can see a list of all bookings, past and future.
7. a traveller can see a list of all bookings, past and future.
